Design considerations:

1. STUDENT: All students enroll in at least one class, which consists of different projects.

2. ENROLL: An enrollment data consists of a student, a class, and a project.

3. CLASS: Each class uses one textbook. This textbook can differ by who teaches this class.

4. INSTRUCTOR: There can be several instructors who teach the same class.
   Each instructor's teaching hours and supervising hours are different, which directly affects their salary.

5. PROJECT: Each project is supervised by one instructor.

6. GROUP: Each group consists of 4 students and one project the group is working on.

7. TEXTBOOK: One textbook is used in one class. Multiple books are stored in a library.

8. LIBRARY: There is only one small library that contains all textbooks.

9. BORROW: Student can borrow textbooks from libraries. The date it is issued, the date to be returned, and the actual date it is returned should be stored.

10. RATING: Many students can rate many instructors, classes, and projects.

11. TABLE: Multiple tables are located in a room. One group is assigned to one table.
    Each table contains parts necessary for the project.

12. PART: Each part can be supplied by multiple supplier.

13. PAYMENT: Each student pays a flat rate. Each student has their own payment record.
